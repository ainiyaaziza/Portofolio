# Portofolio

# About Me üëã
Hi, my name is Aini, since late 2024, I‚Äôve been exploring the world of Quality Assurance (QA) quite unexpectedly through activities I participated in. This journey has been incredibly rewarding, and I‚Äôm truly grateful to have discovered an area where I can grow and thrive.

In this portfolio, I aim to share the knowledge I‚Äôve gained about QA and showcase the practical skills I‚Äôve developed through courses, self-study, and hands-on experience. I‚Äôm committed to continuing my growth in this field. Currently, I‚Äôm also diving into test automation, and my main focus is on deepening my knowledge and honing my skills in this area.

# My Experience üè¢
Being involved as a junior software tester at StudyZi Estonia marked my first professional role focused entirely on QA. During this time, I experienced significant growth in both technical and soft skills, such as developing strong analytical thinking and gaining hands-on experience in testing. In my previous job, one of my key responsibilities was ensuring the proper functioning of internal systems and reporting any bugs or defects to the relevant manager. I became very fond of this role, which ultimately sparked my interest in pursuing a career in QA. Although my previous experience wasn't directly in IT, it helped me build valuable soft skills that I now apply in my QA work.
